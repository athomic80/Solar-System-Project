# 🌌✨ **Solar System Dataset: Excel & Power BI Visuals** 🌍🪐

Welcome to the **Solar System Dataset** project! 🚀 This project brings the wonders of our solar system to life, using a combination of **Excel** for data storage and **Power BI** for dynamic, interactive visualizations! Explore all known stars, planets, dwarf planets, Kuiper Belt objects, and asteroids, along with key insights into their physical characteristics. 🔭

## 📚 **What's Inside?**

- **Solar System Data**: A comprehensive list of celestial bodies, including **stars**, **planets**, **dwarf planets**, **Kuiper Belt objects**, and **asteroids** 🌟🪐
- **Power BI Visualizations**: Engaging, interactive charts to make the data come to life 📊
  - **Bar Chart**: Displaying the number of moons each body has 🌑
  - **Pie Chart**: Showing the percentage of total mass in the solar system for each body ⚖️
  - **Column Charts**: Visualizing gravity and mass by celestial body 🌍
